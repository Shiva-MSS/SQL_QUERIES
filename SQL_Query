#### Create a Table:

CREATE TABLE friends (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE,
  birthday DATE NOT NULL
  );
INSERT INTO friends(id, name, birthday)
VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

INSERT INTO friends(id, name, birthday)
VALUES (2, 'Manisha', '1989-09-10');

INSERT INTO friends(id, name, birthday)
VALUES (3, 'Bhavani', '1990-06-30');


UPDATE friends
SET name = "Storm"
WHERE id = 1;


ALTER TABLE friends
ADD COLUMN Email TEXT;

UPDATE friends
SET email = "storm@codecademy.com"
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM friends
WHERE name = "Storm";

SELECT *
FROM friends

### SQL QUERIES to get NEWYORY RESTRAUNTS DATASET:
SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM nomnom
limit 2;

SELECT*  FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = "Chinese" and review >= 4
Limit 1;

SELECT*  FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = "Italian" and price >= '$$$'
ORDER BY review desc
Limit 1;

SELECT*  FROM nomnom
WHERE name like '%meatball%' ;

SELECT * FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown'
or neighborhood = 'Downtown' 
or neighborhood = 'Chinatown'
Limit 1; 

SELECT name FROM nomnom
WHERE health is NULL 
Limit 1; 

SELECT * FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC
limit 10;

SELECT name, neighborhood, health,
CASE
WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
ELSE 'Poor'
END AS "rating"
FROM nomnom;


### Aggregate functions in SQL :

Calculate the total number of companies in the table.
We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.
What is the highest amount raised by a startup?
Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.
In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?
Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:
Return the average valuation.
Return the average valuation, in each category.
What are the most competitive markets?
First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

What are the most competitive markets?
Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations:
What is the average size of a startup in each location?
What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?

Below code answers above questions.

SELECT COUNT(name) FROM startups;
SELECT SUM(valuation) FROM startups;
SELECT MAX(valuation) FROM startups
WHERE stage ='seed';

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) FROM startups
WHERE valuation is NOT NULl
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY 2 DESC 
limit 1;

SELECT category, count (name) FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING count(2) > 3 ;

SELECT location, AVG(employees) FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500
ORDER BY 2 DESC ;


### MULTIPLE TABLES : SQL QUERY:
Lyft Trip Data

SELECT *
FROM cars;

SELECT *
FROM riders;

SELECT trips.id, riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
ON trips.rider_id = riders.id
limit 1;

SELECT *
FROM trips
INNER JOIN cars
ON trips.car_id = cars.id
Limit 1;

SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2 ;

SELECT AVG(cost) AS "Average_cost/trip"
FROM trips;

SELECT Count(*)
FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500 ;

SELECT Count(*) AS "ACTIVE_CARS "
FROM cars
WHERE status == "active";

SELECT id As "Asset_id"
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
Limit 2;
